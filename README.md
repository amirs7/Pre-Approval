# Univie Elective Modules Pre-Approval Form Simulator
This webpage is a simulator of University of Vienna's form for pre-approval of elective cluster modules which is available [here](http://master.cs.univie.ac.at/computer-science/).

The reason for implementing this page is that the official form is designed for submiting the form and not for playing and working with different options for modules planning. This page is implemented to help work with different options for modules planning and check whether it is legitimate or not.

> Note that it only works for computer science (in general) specialisation.

Online version is available here: [seyhani.ir/pre](http://seyhani.ir/pre)
